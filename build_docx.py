add_h1(doc, "I. Introduction")
add_body(doc,
    "Databases are everywhere in academic institutions — student records, marks, course registrations, attendance. "
    "And yet, for the vast majority of people who might benefit from querying them, the data is effectively locked "
    "behind SQL. You need SQL. Most people don't have SQL. That's the problem this paper is about.")
add_body(doc,
    "The idea of letting people query databases in natural language is not new. Researchers were working on it in "
    "the early 1970s, when relational algebra and computational linguistics were both still finding their feet [1, 2]. "
    "LUNAR, built at BBN to answer questions about Apollo moon rock samples, is usually cited as the first practically "
    "deployed natural language database interface [2]. It was impressively functional for its time, and impressively "
    "brittle — any phrasing the grammar hadn't seen before simply failed.")
add_body(doc,
    "Fast forward to 2018 and BERT changed a lot of things [3]. Pre-trained transformer models could suddenly "
    "generalise across linguistic variation in ways that handwritten grammars never could. The Spider benchmark "
    "gave the community a common evaluation ground [4], and scores have climbed from mid-50s in 2019 to above "
    "85% by 2023 with GPT-4-based approaches [8]. On paper, the problem is nearly solved.")
add_body(doc,
    "But 'nearly solved on Spider' is not the same as 'solved for a university portal running on a shared server.' "
    "The best systems are enormous, slow, and opaque. If a query produces a wrong SQL, there's no easy way to "
    "explain why without retraining. For a domain-specific deployment where the schema is small, query types are "
    "predictable, and interpretability matters, a lighter approach is worth exploring.")
add_body(doc,
    "That's what we built. NL2SQL handles natural language queries over a three-table academic database using "
    "deterministic intent detection, transformer-based semantic schema linking, and template-based SQL generation. "
    "No generative model, no beam search, no probabilistic decoding. The tradeoff is obvious — arbitrary SQL is out "
    "of scope. But within what academic staff and students actually ask, the system performs well, explains itself, "
    "and runs on hardware that's already available.")

add_h1(doc, "II. Related Work")
add_h2(doc, "A. Rule-Based Systems")
add_body(doc,
    "The earliest NLIDBs worked by exhaustively enumerating grammar rules mapping sentence patterns to query "
    "fragments. LUNAR [2] did this for a narrow geochemical domain and worked well within scope. LADDER [9] "
    "and LIFER [10] tried to scale the idea to broader English — impressive demonstrations, almost useless in "
    "practice. Any synonym, reordering, or unfamiliar construction broke them. You cannot enumerate human "
    "language variation by hand. NaLIR [11] tried dependency parsing for better robustness, but still relied "
    "on lexical overlap between query tokens and column names.")
add_h2(doc, "B. Statistical and Seq2Seq Models")
add_body(doc,
    "Seq2SQL [5] framed text-to-SQL as a generation problem using reinforcement learning on WikiSQL. SQLNet [15] "
    "decomposed SQL generation into predicting each clause independently — SELECT column, aggregator, WHERE "
    "condition — as separate classification problems. This decomposition is conceptually close to what our "
    "template engine does, with learned classifiers replaced by deterministic logic.")
add_h2(doc, "C. Transformer-Based Systems")
add_body(doc,
    "IRNet [16] introduced an intermediate SQL representation hitting 54.7% exact match on Spider. RATSQL [7] "
    "added relation-aware self-attention reaching 69.6%. BRIDGE [6] appended sample database values to the "
    "encoder, reaching 71.1%. GPT-4 fine-tuning now exceeds 85% [8] but at inference costs orders of magnitude "
    "beyond our target. Hallucinated column names are unacceptable in an academic advisory tool.")
add_h2(doc, "D. Schema Linking via Dense Embeddings")
add_body(doc,
    "Schema linking has been called the hardest sub-problem in text-to-SQL [19]. Dense retrieval [20] solves "
    "this by comparing semantic embeddings rather than surface tokens. Sentence-BERT [17] and its distilled "
    "variants like all-MiniLM-L6-v2 [18] produce 384-dimensional representations where cosine similarity "
    "captures genuine semantic proximity. We use this for table and column selection — the single component "
    "handling linguistic variation the rule layer cannot.")

    "one of six classes: COUNT, AVERAGE, TOP_N, BOTTOM_N, FILTER_GT, FILTER_LT, using ordered keyword "
    "trigger matching. Number extraction runs in parallel via digit regex plus word-to-numeral lookup.")
add_body(doc,

    "No JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, or subqueries. Synonym dictionary requires manual maintenance. Schema metadata "
    "must be authored by hand for any new database. The 60-query evaluation is a proof of concept, not a "
    "production benchmark — real query logs would look very different.")
add_h2(doc, "D. Future Directions")
add_body(doc,
    "(1) JOIN detection: a two-table intent class with foreign-key lookup covers the most impactful failure. "
    "(2) Confidence-based routing: queries below a similarity threshold go to a generative fallback. "
    "(3) Auto-description: use a lightweight LLM to generate column descriptions from names and sample "
    "values, eliminating manual schema authoring.")

add_h1(doc, "VIII. Conclusion")
add_body(doc,
    "NL2SQL demonstrates that a useful natural language database interface doesn't require a billion-parameter "
    "model. Combining deterministic intent detection with a compact sentence transformer for schema linking and "
    "a small set of SQL templates achieves 88.3% execution accuracy across 60 test queries with 163 ms average "
    "latency on CPU hardware. The embedding matcher contributed a 25-point improvement over a keyword-only "
    "baseline — confirming dense semantic representations add real value even within a predominantly "
    "rule-based pipeline.")
add_body(doc,
    "Three of seven failures came from one missing capability — JOIN generation. The architecture is modular "
    "enough to add it without touching other components. For institutions looking to lower the barrier between "
    "staff and their data, without the cost and opacity of large generative models, this hybrid approach is "
    "worth taking seriously.")
